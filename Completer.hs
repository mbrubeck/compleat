-- The "Completer" type is a function that takes a list of input tokens and
-- returns a list of possible completions.  Each completion can be a new list
-- of tokens (which will be handed to the next completer in a sequence) or
-- an action to generate a list of strings.
--
-- This module provides a set of primitive completers, and combinators to build
-- new completers through alternation, repetition, and sequencing.  These are
-- essentially identical to the parser combinators in "Monadic Parsing" by Hutton
-- and Meijer, except that they short-circuit: if all of the input is consumed by
-- one completer in a sequence, then the sequence returns the results of that
-- completer, rather than failure.
